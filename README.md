# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Each year number of deaths is increasing
extremely because of breast cancer. It is the most frequent type of
all cancers and the major cause of death in women worldwide. Any
development for prediction and diagnosis of cancer disease is capital
important for a healthy life. Consequently, high accuracy in cancer
prediction is important to update the treatment aspect and the
survivability standard of patients. Machine learning techniques can
bring a large contribute on the process of prediction and early
diagnosis of breast cancer.

Machine Learning Algorithms that I have used for predicting accuracy of the model are as follow:

Logistic Regression

Model Flowchart:

Accuracy of the model with each supervised machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression: Accuracy score of the logistic regression is about 0.92 , which is  good.
